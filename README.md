## Getting started

### Developers

The code was made with Flutter. For first steps with it, please go to:
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

To edit and develop the code, we recommend the editor [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio) which includes several emulators for Android Phones.
If you want to make changes to the iOS-Version of the app and test them, you probably have to use 
[XCode](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

Run the following commands to ensure the app works as intended:

```bash
  dart pub get && dart run build_runner build
```

```bash
  flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```
